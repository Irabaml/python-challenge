In the PyPoll challenge, the requirements were to calculate the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and also the winner of the election based on popular vote

I started by finding the election_data.csv file from the Resources folder and creating the election.txt where I had to write the result.
I defined different variables such as:
- candindate_votes for the total votes for each candidate
- total_vote for the total of votes for the whole candidate
- winner for the name who will have the greatest number of votes

After opening and reading the csv file, I created the for loop to display the total votes and increment the candidate's vote count.

I created another loop that helps me to calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate and the received votes. Please find more information in the comments in the codes. Then, I determined the winner of the election based on the popular vote by applying the condition.
